I was never a huge fan of programs like Gimp or Photoshop, because all I ever wanted to do was take notes for my classes and draw diagrams with my tablet, and the programs I found either felt too constricting, unintuitive, or expensive. Thus, FreePad was born. 
I aim to do a lot with this project, so I guess it remains to be seen what actually happens!

Please download and give it a try if you're interested!
